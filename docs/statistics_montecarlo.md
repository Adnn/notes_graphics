* **pseudorandom** sequence of numbers appears to be statistically random, despite having be prencuded by a completely deterministic and repeatable process.

* **quasirandom** sequence, or **low-discrepancy** sequence has the property that for any $N$, the sequence $X_1, .., X_N$ has low discrepancy ("well distributed", the proportion of points falling into a set $B$ being close to proportional to the measure of $B$).

* **Probability Density Function** (PDF) is a function $f(x)$ used to specify the probability of an _absolutely continuous_ random variable $X$ falling withing a particular range:
  $$P(a \leq X \leq b) = \int_a^b f(x)dx$$
